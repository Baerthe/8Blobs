The [[Tool]] folder contains node-based services that can be added to scenes as needed. These tools provide specific functionality and interact with the core services to implement game features.
They can depend on core services but should *never* be referenced by core services to avoid circular dependencies; they should only be injected by instance copying via the [[Services]] provider singleton.
