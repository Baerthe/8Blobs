### This does not currently function, it is a work in progress.
A simple Survivors Style Game Template made with Godot Engine 4.5.
## Overview
This project is made to be a starting point for anyone wanting to make a game similar to the "Survivors" genre of indie games. It includes basic movement, shooting, enemy AI, and a simple UI. The project is structured to be easily expandable and modifiable. The project is open source and free to use for any purpose.
The project is using a "Component-Based Architecture with Data-Driven Design" approach, where game objects are composed of reusable components that define their behavior and properties. This allows for easy modification and extension of game objects without altering core logic.

## Resources and Entities
The project uses a resource and entity system to manage game objects and their properties. Resources are defined in the `entities` folder, while scenes for various game objects are located in the `assets/scenes` folder. This allows for easy modification and extension of game objects without altering core logic. Objects in the game, like mobs and items, are defined as scenes build of both an entity script, nodes and resources. The idea behind this is to maximize reusability and modularity; while allowing for designer to easily create and modify game objects without coding.
